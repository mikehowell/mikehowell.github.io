title: Sharing files via the Cloud

Sharing files like videos via a Cloud provider is a great way to share files.  

Firstly, it allows you to save the file in your cloud storage which serves as a backup for you and secondly, sending large files via email is problematic as mail providers often restrict the size of attachments and the size is often much smaller than the average video file.

There are several Cloud providers worth checking out:

- [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/)
- [Microsoft OneDrive](https://www.microsoft.com/en-nz/microsoft-365/onedrive/online-cloud-storage)
- [Apple iCloud](https://www.icloud.com/)
- [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/basic)

I mention the providers above as they are well known and provide a free tier with limited storage, however, there are many more Cloud providers which offer similar services, so that may warrant further investigation if you are interested in what's out there.  This is a good [article](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3412206/best-free-cloud-storage-2020.html) worth checking out.

The free storage provided by these companies is:

- Google Drive = 15GB Free
- OneDrive = 5GB Free
- iCloud = 5GB Free
- Dropbox = 2GB Free

If you have a GMail account or Apple account, you already have access to Drive or iCloud respectively.  
If you find that the storage provided isn't adequate, you can always pay a monthly fee to upgrade to larger storage as I've chosen to do.  I've opted for OneDrive as it gives me access to Office 365.

It's relatively straight forward to upload a video to one of these services, especially from your mobile phone.

1. Ensure that the mobile app for the cloud provider is installed on your device.  These can be installed from the respecitve app stores.
2. Select the video from your gallery and then chose the share option and share it to your cloud storage e.g. Google Drive
3. Open the cloud app and locate the video and chose share, this time it's to share an internet link to the file in your cloud storage
    - there is usually an option to select who to share it with, this can assist you in restricting who has access to the file
    - however, if you explore the options in the sharing screen, you can change this so any one with the internet link can view it.  
    - this depends on what you are sharing and how sensitive it is as to who you want to share it with.
4. Copy the link from step 3 and share it via email.

As most school kids have access to Google Classroom and so does their teacher, it's probably easiest to share videos or any other large files via Google Drive.
